## Introduction to Artificial Neural Network (ANN):
An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) used in deep learning, consists of different layers connected to each other and it is a computational model that is inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information. It learns from huge volumes of data and uses complex algorithms to train a neural net. Artificial Neural Networks have generated a lot of excitement in Machine Learning research and industry, thanks to many breakthrough results in speech recognition, computer vision and text processing.


## Let’s Understand Single Neuron:

The neuron is the basic unit of computation in a neural network and it often called a node or unit. It receives input from some other nodes or from an external source and computes an output. Each input has an associated weight (w), which is assigned based on its relative importance to other inputs. The node applies a function f (defined below) to the weighted sum of its inputs as shown in the figure below.

Now, if I write the third formula using data sets and test patterns, it will be looking like this.

Euclidean Distance = ![equation2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/fknnimg/fknne2.PNG)


I wish after using the data sets X and test pattern P, someone will not actually understand what’s going on in the formula. Then let’s try with the values of X and P. Here, for the value of X, I use the values of X1(0.8, 0.8) from the data sheet and for the value of P (test pattern), use P(3.0, 2.0).

![equations3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/fknnimg/fknne3.PNG)

I wish it’s now understandable for everyone. Now, dig into the mathematics and let’s see test pattern P(3.0, 2.0) belongs to which class. In this example, we have only three classes and they are 1, 2, and 3.

Let’s find the distance between X and P and find the five lowest results because k = 5

![equation4]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/fknnimg/fknne4.PNG)

Here the list of five lowest results with their class after calculating the distance between X and P. As we consider k = 5 then the nearest neighbor are given below in the list.

| 1st lowest | Class| 2nd lowest | Class | 3rd lowest | Class | 4th lowest | Class | 5th lowest | Class |
|:---------: | :--: | :--------: | :---: | :--------: | :---: | :--------: | :---: | :--------: | :---: |
| X16 = 1.12 | 3 | X7 = 1.13 | 2 | X14 = 1.31 | 3 | X6 = 1.41 | 2 | X17 = 1.41 | 3 |

Now we consider that, 

Class 1 = 0, (Class 1 has no members)

Class 2 = 2, (Class 2 has 2 members and they are X6, X7), 

Class 3 = 3, (Class 3 has 3 members and they are X14, X16, X17). 


After finishing all the calculation from above, we consider the test pattern P= (3.0, 2.0) and k = 5 then nearest patterns are X16, X7, X14, X6 and X17.


The formula for the calculation is,

![equation5]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/fknnimg/fknne5.PNG)

Here, I consider m = 2. We can assign any kinds of value to m. So, as I choose m = 2, then 

![equation6]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/fknnimg/fknne6.PNG)

We know Class 1 has no patterns like X1, X2, X16 then we consider ![equation10]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/fknnimg/fknne10.PNG).

For Class 2, we consider ![equation11]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/fknnimg/fknne11.PNG) will be 1 for patterns X6 and X7 and 0 for patters X16, X14 and X7.

For Class 3, we consider ![equation12]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/fknnimg/fknne11.PNG) will be 1 for patterns X16, X14 and X7 and 0 for Patterns X6 and X7.


Calculation for Class 2 applying values of X6, X7, X16, X14 and X7: 

![equation7]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/fknnimg/fknne7.PNG)


Calculation for Class 2 applying values of X6, X7, X16, X14 and X7:  

![equation8]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/fknnimg/fknne8.PNG)


So, 

![equation9]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/fknnimg/fknne9.PNG)

If we choose a maximum result from three classes, then test pattern P (3.0, 2.0) belongs to class 3.
