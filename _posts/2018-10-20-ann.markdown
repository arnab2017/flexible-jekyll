## Introduction to Artificial Neural Network (ANN):
An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) used in deep learning, consists of different layers connected to each other and it is a computational model that is inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information. It learns from huge volumes of data and uses complex algorithms to train a neural net. Artificial Neural Networks have generated a lot of excitement in Machine Learning research and industry, thanks to many breakthrough results in speech recognition, computer vision and text processing.

## Letâ€™s Understand Single Neuron:
The neuron is the basic unit of computation in a neural network and it often called a node or unit. It receives input from some other nodes or from an external source and computes an output. Each input has an associated weight (w), which is assigned based on its relative importance to other inputs. The node applies a function f (defined below) to the weighted sum of its inputs as shown in the figure below.
