## Introduction to Artificial Neural Network (ANN):
<p align="justify">
An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) used in deep learning, consists of different layers connected to each other and it is a computational model that is inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information. It learns from huge volumes of data and uses complex algorithms to train a neural net. Artificial Neural Networks have generated a lot of excitement in Machine Learning research and industry, thanks to many breakthrough results in speech recognition, computer vision and text processing.

## Let’s Understand Single Neuron:
<p align="justify">
The neuron is the basic unit of computation in a neural network and it often called a node or unit. It receives input from some other nodes or from an external source and computes an output. Each input has an associated weight (w), which is assigned based on its relative importance to other inputs. The node applies a function f (defined below) to the weighted sum of its inputs as shown in the figure below.

<p align="justify">
The above network takes numerical inputs like X1, X2 and has weights w1 and w2 associated with those inputs. There is another input 1 with weight b associated with it. It is called Bias (b). 

The output Y from the neuron is computed as shown in the figure 1. The function f is non-linear and is called the activation function. Activation function is used to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron. Every activation function takes a single number and performs a certain fixed mathematical operation on it. There are several types of activation functions we use.

##Sigmoid Function:
Sigmoid function also known as logistic function or logistic curve and it is look like “S” shape. The equation of sigmoid function is given below:
</p>

<p align="justify">
In the sigmoid function equation “e” stands for Euler’s number, “x0” stands for the x-value of the sigmoid midpoint, L stands for the curve’s maximum value and k stands for the steepness of the curve. The main reason why we use sigmoid function is because it exists between 0 to 1. Therefore, it is especially used for models where we have to predict the probability as an output. Since probability of anything exists only between the range of 0 and 1, sigmoid is the right choice. The function is differentiable. That means, we can find the slope of the sigmoid curve at any two points. The function is monotonic but function’s derivative is not. The logistic sigmoid function can cause a neural network to get stuck at the training time. The softmax function is a more generalized logistic activation function, which is used for multiclass classification. Figure of sigmoid function given below.

##Threshold Function:
<p align="justify">
A threshold function is a Boolean function that determines whether a value equality of its inputs exceeded a certain threshold. A device that implements such logic is known as a threshold gate. It’s also known as Step function or Heaviside step function. The equation of threshold function is given below:
</p>
e2
<p align="justify">
Using second equation, Let n Boolean inputs be *x1, x2*… *xn*. *f* is a function that decides whether *w1x1 + w2x2 + … + wnxn = t* where *t* is a real number called the threshold and *w1, w2, .. wn* are real-numbered weights. A threshold function on *n* Boolean inputs *x1, x2, …, xn* is then a Boolean function that decides whether *w1x1 + w2x2 + … + wnxn ≥ t*. Figure of threshold function given below.
